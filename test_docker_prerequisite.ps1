Write-Host "=== Docker as Prerequisite Test ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "`n1. Prerequisites Order:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   ✓ Git" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   ✓ Docker (NEW - now checked before StrangeLoop)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   ✓ Azure CLI" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   ✓ Git LFS" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "`n2. When Docker is missing, the script will:" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host "   • Use elevated installation if Group Policy blocks it" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Wait for Docker Desktop to start up" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Verify Docker command is available" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Only proceed to StrangeLoop installation after Docker is ready" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "`n3. In Development Environment section:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   • Docker installation is skipped (already done in prerequisites)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Focus on engine configuration (Linux vs Windows containers)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
