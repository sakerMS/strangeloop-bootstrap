# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts that support the StrangeLoop CLI setup process.

## Purpose

The scripts directory is intended for utility scripts that support the main setup functionality, such as:
- Helper scripts for specific setup tasks
- Configuration utilities
- Platform-specific utilities
- Development and maintenance scripts

## Current Status

Currently, this directory is prepared for future utility scripts. Test scripts have been moved to the `tests/` directory for better organization.

## Note

These scripts are part of the StrangeLoop CLI bootstrap process and support the main `setup_strangeloop.ps1` script functionality. For test scripts, see the `tests/` directory.
